# Parameter tuning-free missing-feature reconstruction for robust sound recognition
This repo provides source code and data linked to the IEEE JSTSP paper entitled "Parameter tuning-free missing-feature reconstruction for robust sound recognition".

# How to use the code
+ the matrix completion folder provides our parameter tuning-free matrix completion algorithm 
+ the dnn folder provides the dnn training code that is used to evaluate the network performance under different extent of noise
