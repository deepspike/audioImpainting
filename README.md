# Parameter tuning-free missing-feature reconstruction for robust sound recognition
This repo provides source code and data linked to the IEEE JSTSP paper entitled "Parameter tuning-free missing-feature reconstruction for robust sound recognition".

# How to use the code
+ the matrix completion folder provides our parameter tuning-free matrix completion algorithm writing in MATLAB
+ the dnn folder provides the Pytorch code that is used to evaluate the DNN performance under different extent of noise

# We tested our code under the following environments
+ Matlab = R2017b
+ ubuntu == 16.04
+ Pytorch == 1.4.0
